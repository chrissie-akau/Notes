What is JavaScript?
    - Dynamic weakly-typed programming language
    - Interpreted "on the fly" complied language
    - "Hosted language": Runs in different environments (or example in browser)
    - Most prominent use-case: Run code in a browser (on a webpage)

How is JavaScript Executed?
    - Your code goes into a JavaScript Engine which is built-into the browser (Chrome is V8, Firefox is SpiderMonkey etc.).  It parses code, complies t to machine code and executes the machine code (on a single thread) and you see the effects on the webpage.

Dynamic and Weakly Typed Language?
    - Not pre-compiled instead parsed and complied "on the fly" 
    - Code evaluated adn executed at runtime
    - Code can change at runtime (ex. type of a variable)
