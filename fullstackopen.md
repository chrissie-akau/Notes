Fundamentals of Web Apps

HTTP Protocol -> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML.  It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.  HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response.
    - Application Layer -> an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network.
    - HTTP is a STATELESS Protocol -> the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

GET Method -> HTTP GET requests a representation of the specified resource.  Requests using GET should only be used to request data (shouldn't include data).
